I’m Curt Poff. I’ve worked as a producer/project manager for the past 15 years, now with web developer added to my array of skills.

I’m married to the lovely [Go Fit Girl!](http://gofitgirl.com) We recently relocated to Portland from the Bay Area. But hang on … we’re not typical California migrants. My wife and I originally met when we worked in Salem, and I went to college at [Portland State](http://pdx.edu). So it’s more of a ‘returning home’ scenario.

I’m a huge sports fan. My teams include the Kansas City Royals, Chiefs, Mizzou (football & hoops), Newcastle United (I know, right?), Portland State, Timbers, and Trail Blazers. It’s a lot, I know.
