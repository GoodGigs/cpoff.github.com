        <title>Still on the lookout</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Summer is drawing to a close here in Portland, and I’m still looking for work. I had a good month of job search once my code class was done. But no solid offers came from it. So I’ll continue the search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon I’ll likely expand the job search from just developer positions to include web producer and project manager gigs. I’m still determined to be a developer but I’m also sensitive to the fact that I need steady work. The sooner the better. I hope it all works out.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Jekyll is now running</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently installed the Jekyll blog engine on my GitHub Pages site. All good so far but the configuration is going to take some time.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Panic!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Today several of us from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.portlandcodeschool.com&quot;&gt;Portland Code School&lt;/a&gt; took a tour of &lt;a href=&quot;http://panic.com/&quot;&gt;Panic Software&lt;/a&gt;. We do about one tour a week and this one was pretty unique.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Panic is the first company we toured where I’m a customer. I’ve been a long-time Transmit FTP user. Plus I’ve become a bit of a Coda fan lately. First class software all around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, this was the first pure software business we’ve seen. It’s not an agency or coders-for-hire outfit. They build their own stuff and sell it for a living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most-interesting thing about Panic is their absolute lack of employee turnover. They only have about 15 employees to begin with. And the fellow speaking today said they’ve only had two departures in his tenure (since 2011).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In today’s tech market, that’s absolutely tremendous. I guess it shows that if you take care of your employees, you don’t have to deal with turnover.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>More fish, please</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the years, my wife and I got into the habit of eating most meals separately. The idea evolved from Ann’s dietary needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She eats pretty healthy. I usually piece together what I can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we returned to the Pacific Northwest - with both of us being around the house more - we have started eating a lot of fresh fish. Salmon and steelhead in particular.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about salmon is that it requires very little help. You bake for 10-15 minutes and send it straight to the plate with no need for oil or sauce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pair it with some green beans and garlic toast and you have my go-to meal for 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
