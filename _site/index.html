        <p>Two weeks ago I shot my mouth off about how every single football team in my corner happened to win. Royals, Chiefs (went on the road to thump the Texans), Mizzou (looked horrible against an inferior opponent), Arizona, Portland State (knocked off Washington State for the school’s first ever win against a Pac-12 opponent).</p>

        <p>Now that I’ve spoken to several companies about web developer jobs, it’s clear the market is more competitive than I originally estimated. I’ve been dead-set against pursuing internships or volunteer opportunities in favor of a full-time (<em>paid</em>) role. I plan to maintain that strategy for as long as possible.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>I feel like I finally have a grip on Jekyll as it runs in GitHub Pages. It took several attempts to install the Jekyll engine (parser) inside the existing directory and setup, but it seems to be working. I had to delete the Pages directory a couple times and it looks like I lost some update counts. But whatevs.</p>

        <p>We’ve been playing around with static site generators. Since I’m already using GitHub and Pages it seemed only logical that I use for testing. Jekyll is pretty straightforward so far. Let’s see how I can make this easier.</p>
